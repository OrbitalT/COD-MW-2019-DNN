# COD-MW-2019-DNN
Deep Neural Networks for Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2019

Contained are the scripts and validation data as well as the .h5 files for various Call of Duty Modern Warfare Neural Networks

Only limited validation will be provided in this repo. The base training dataset is > 2GB.

### Intent
Look at a 200x200 pixel block at the center of the uers screen, determine if there is an enemy somewhere in that block. If you have ever played COD, then there is a high chance that by just looking at the below, you would agree if there is an enemy in these images.

There are some cases in COD, where just loooking at a 200x200 block, its impossible to tell if its friend or foe. Take the scenerio that the user has been flashbanged. The user doesent see the colord indicator above the player.
